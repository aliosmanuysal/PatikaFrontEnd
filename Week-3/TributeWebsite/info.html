        <h2>Chuck Palahniuk</h2>
        <p>Charles Michael "Chuck" Palahniuk (born February 21, 1962) is an American novelist who describes his work as transgressional fiction. He has published 19 novels, three nonfiction books, two graphic novels, and two adult coloring books, as well as several short stories. His first published novel was Fight Club, which was adapted into a film of the same title.</p>
        <h3>Early Career</h3>
        <p>He wrote for the local newspaper for a short while but then began working for Freightliner Trucks as a diesel mechanic, continuing until his writing career took off. During that time, he wrote manuals on fixing trucks and had a stint as a journalist, a job he would return to from time to time until he became a successful novelist. After casually attending a seminar by Landmark Education, Palahniuk quit his job as a journalist and began writing fiction. He attended writing workshops and volunteered at a hospice as an escort, providing transportation for terminally ill people, taking them to support group meetings. He experienced enough upon the death of a patient to whom he had grown attached.</p>
        <h3>Fight Club</h3>
        <p>After his first novel, Invisible Monsters, was rejected by all publishers he submitted it to, he began work on his first published novel, Fight Club. Palahniuk wrote this story in his spare time while working for Freightliner. After initially publishing it as a short story (which became chapter 6 of the novel) in the 1995 compilation Pursuit of Happiness, Palahniuk expanded it into a full novel, which, contrary to his expectations, received positive reviews and garnered a short shelf life.</p>
